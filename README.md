<h1><b>DEFO</b>, A Restaurant_Cuisine_Demand_Predictor </h1>
This project is implemented using ML to predict the demand of the given dataset concerned with reviews of customers of a food company. The data was analysed using python and certain trends, findings were discovered in the process. Three ML models were trained namely <b>Random Forest regressor, XGB Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor</b>. Extra Trees Regressor shows highest r2_score with Random Forest regressor following it.
