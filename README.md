# Restaurant_Cuisine_Demand_Predictor

This project is implemented using ML to predict the demand of the given dataset concerned with reviews of customers of a food company. The data was analysed using python and certain trends, findings were discovered in the process. Three ML models were trained namely Random Forest regressor, XGB Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor. Extra Trees Regressor shows highest r2_score with Random Forest regressor following it.
### ALGORITHMS r2_scores:
* Random Forest regressor :- 0.9286105766896842
* XGB Regressor :- 0.7636484968153312
* Extra Trees Regressor :- 0.9385324707057678

## Future Scope:
Time Series predictions can be done on the data for more accurate understanding and better accuracy.

# HOW TO RUN THE APP:
* Download the repository as zip file and extract the contents.
* Open command prompt in the "APP" folder of the extracted file.
* Type the following command "python app.py" and press enter.
* The local host address will be displayed which can be used to experience the model working.
