<h1>Restaurant_Cuisine_Demand_Predictor </h1>

This project is implemented using ML to predict the demand of the given dataset concerned with reviews of customers of a food company. The data was analysed using python and certain trends, findings were discovered in the process. Three ML models were trained namely <b>Random Forest regressor, XGB Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor</b>. Extra Trees Regressor shows highest r2_score with Random Forest regressor following it.

<h2>ALGORITHMS r2_scores: </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Random Forest regressor :- 0.9286105766896842 </li>
<li>  XGB Regressor :- 0.7636484968153312 </li>
  <li> Extra Trees Regressor :- 0.9385324707057678 </li>
 </ul>

## Future Scope:
Time Series predictions can be done on the data for more accurate understanding and better accuracy.
